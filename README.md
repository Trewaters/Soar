# Soar

Found yoga poses [here](https://www.pocketyoga.com/pose/)

## branches

* `aum` - working branch
* `version_stable` - stable version this is the stable build of the most current version I am working on.
* `version_010` - release version 0.1.0. The "version" branches are locked after release.

I follow Semantic Versioning for releases. [Read more here](https://semver.org/) ...**[TLDR](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2)**: *"A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.*

## Milestones

* [ ] 1.0.0 - MVP ( 4 sections, each with material).
* [ ] 2.0.0 - Create User Profiles and allow them to save their progress
* [ ] 2.x.0 - User Profile Customizations
* [ ] 2.x.0 - Users can Add more poses, etc.
* [ ] 2.x.0 - Users can create custom flows

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
