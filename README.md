### Known Bugs

No Known Bugs!

What you are experiencing is a feature ðŸ˜‰ ! Open a [github issue](https://github.com/Trewaters/soar/issues) if you disagree.

## Branches

1. [`develop`](https://soar-develop.vercel.app/) - active work
2. [`main`](https://soar-main.vercel.app/) â€“ stable branch, create develop from this but only merge stable branches (publised to Vercel)
3. [`version_stable`](https://soar-jade.vercel.app/) - stable version this is the stable build of the most current version I am working on.
4. Feature/â€¦ - any feature I am working on that could go back into main when complete.
   `version_010` - release version 0.1.0.

The "version" branches are locked after release.

I follow Semantic Versioning for releases. [Read more here](https://semver.org/) ...**[TLDR](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2)**: _"A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0._

### Deployment

**Deployed on Vercel**

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Changelog

**Types of changes**

- `ADD`: for new features.
- `UPDATE`: for changes in existing functionality.
- `DEPRECATE`: for soon-to-be removed features.
- `REMOVE`: for now removed features.
- `FIX`: for any bug fixes.
- `SECURITY`: in case of vulnerabilities.
- `AUDIT`: code clean up. Carefully removing unnecessary files.

### Development server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Dev tip: sometimes I need to clear my npm cache so the versions are installed correctly

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

**Prisma Databse**

Start using Prisma Client in Node.js (See: https://pris.ly/d/client)

```js
import { PrismaClient } from './prisma/generated/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

or start using Prisma Client at the edge (See: https://pris.ly/d/accelerate)

```js
import { PrismaClient } from './prisma/generated/client/edge'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

**Known Error (as of 2024-06-30 11:38:23)**

$ npm exec prisma migrate dev
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma\schema.prisma
Datasource "db": MongoDB database "yogaDBSandbox" at "localhost:27017"

Error: The "mongodb" provider is not supported with this command. For more info see https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb
0: schema_core::state::DevDiagnostic
at schema-engine\core\src\state.rs:276

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

```bash
npm exec prisma db push
```

This is failing for mongodb at the moment

```bash
npm exec prisma migrate dev
```

### Running unit tests

execute the unit tests via **Jest** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Running end-to-end tests

execute the end-to-end tests via **?Test Kit** [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Linting

1. Eslint rules

### "Pushing good code"

QUESTION: "Am I pushing good code?"

_If you *Answer yes* to everything on the list below then you are pushing GREAT CODE!_

1. `npm run dev` and there aren't any errors in the server terminal or client (web browser) console.
2. `npm run build` no breaking build errors. Warnings are acceptable but should be minimized. Errors are not acceptable.
3. `npm run cover` to make sure no unit test are failing. Coverage goal is (A) 100%, (B) 90%, (C) 80%.
4. Push `develop` branch to hosting. Verify that the build was Successful and show **Ready** in vercel hosting. Then check how the app works on the web. Test with desktop and mobile device. Again checking the client (web browser) console for errors. "Click things and navigate around the app" especially any features your code touches.

## TO DO

2024-07-20 06:53:15

- Add permanent IP Address to MongoDB Atlas Cluster whitelist for access. Upon deployment of non-alpha. So at the end of alpha phase of development.

#### Create Release Milestones

Here is ChatGPT instructions on how to create release milestones that will use for my changelong under the "Versions" section.

To manage releases on GitHub like the example you saw with `https://github.com/Level/level/releases/tag/0.9.0`, you'll need to use GitHub's release management features. This allows you to create, edit, and view releases that group together iterations of your project, often marking different versions or milestones with tags.

Hereâ€™s a basic guide on how to create a release for your project on GitHub:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Go to the main page of your repository on GitHub.
2. **Access Releases**: Click on the "Releases" section, usually found on the right sidebar under the "Code" tab.
3. **Draft a New Release**: Click on "Draft a new release" or the "Create a new release" button at the top of the release list.
4. **Tag Your Release**: Choose a tag for your release. You can select an existing tag or create a new one. If you create a new tag, you will need to specify which branch the tag is created from.
5. **Fill Out Release Information**: Add a title and a description for your release. Here, you can include detailed information about whatâ€™s included in the release, bug fixes, or new features.
6. **Attach Binaries** (optional): If you want to include compiled programs, executables, or binary files, you can attach them to the release.
7. **Mark as Pre-release** (if applicable): If the release is not yet ready for production and is considered unstable, you can mark it as a pre-release.
8. **Publish the Release**: Once youâ€™ve configured all the details, click on "Publish release" to make it public. Alternatively, you can save it as a draft to continue working on it later.

To see your releases, you can visit the "Releases" section of your repository. If you haven't created any releases yet, this page will guide you to make your first one. Additionally, if GitHub Discussions is enabled, you can also link a discussion to your release for community interaction.

For your specific repository, you can start creating and managing releases by visiting [your projectâ€™s release section](https://github.com/Trewaters/soar/releases).

This process not only helps in managing different versions but also allows your users to download specific snapshots of the code and associated files.

#### TIPS: Release tags

When creating a new release in GitHub, the tags you choose can reflect your project's versioning strategy. Commonly, semantic versioning (SemVer) is used, which helps manage versions by conveying meaning about the underlying changes. Here are some suggested tags you could use based on the type of updates made to your project:

1. **Major Releases (`vX.0.0`)**: Use this for major changes that may include breaking changes or significant features. For example, `v2.0.0` indicates a significant jump that might include changes not backward compatible with `v1.x.x`.

2. **Minor Releases (`vX.Y.0`)**: Employ this tag for minor feature additions or improvements that are backward-compatible. For instance, `v1.3.0` could be a release that adds new functionalities to version `1.2.x` but does not break any existing functionality.

3. **Patch Releases (`vX.Y.Z`)**: This is for small bug fixes or security patches that do not affect the API or major components of the software. For example, `v1.3.1` might include a small bug fix on top of the `v1.3.0` release.

4. **Pre-release Versions**: For beta, alpha, or release candidates, you might use tags like `v1.4.0-alpha`, `v1.4.0-beta`, or `v1.4.0-rc.1`. These tags indicate that the release is not yet in its final form and is meant for testing.

5. **Build Metadata**: Sometimes, additional build metadata can be attached to a version, such as `v1.4.0+20210901` indicating a build made on September 1, 2021.

Using clear and consistent tags helps users and contributors understand the progression of your project and the stability of each release. For a detailed understanding of versioning and to get more insights on how to effectively manage your project releases, GitHub provides a helpful guide on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Implementing a good versioning strategy with appropriate tags ensures that your project's releases are predictable, manageable, and less prone to errors.
