- Special thank you to my mom, wife, and daughter! Without their love and support this would gone nowhere.
- Gratitude is the attitude!

## NOTES

- Timeline: I started this in July 2023. I hope to have a MVP by the end of the year. I am working on this in my spare time, so it may take longer. I am also learning NextJS as I go, so that will slow me down as well.

### Current Goals

- **Feature Goal**, record personal yoga practice in app.
- **Posture Card**, The Card comes up on Search. Polish the look of it.
- **Top Navigation**, Use a component for Top Navigation.
- **Header**, Make a header component.

### Known Bugs

**Theme broken, not global** (2024-01-21 15:31:30)

Theme is only showing on top level page. Not passing down to children like "flow-series" page. I added a wrapper to make it work.

## Branches

- [`main`](https://soar-main.vercel.app/) – stable branch, create develop from this but only merge stable branches (publised to Vercel)
- [`develop`](https://soar-develop.vercel.app/) - active work
- [`version_stable`](https://soar-jade.vercel.app/) - stable version this is the stable build of the most current version I am working on.
  Feature/… - any feature I am working on that could go back into main when complete.
- `version_010` - release version 0.1.0.
- The "version" branches are locked after release.

I follow Semantic Versioning for releases. [Read more here](https://semver.org/) ...**[TLDR](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2)**: _"A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0._
